# ChoreoTyper

A Windows Forms application that accepts a .txt file as an argument, splits it on empty lines, displays each entry (multi-line supported) in a list, shows an indicator for the active entry, and provides three actions (Move Prev, Move Next, Type) accessible via global shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+PageUp, Ctrl+Shift+PageDown, Ctrl+Shift+Insert.

## Usage

```
ChoreoTyper.exe path\to\file.txt
```

- The active entry is highlighted
